# Srclib Nomos

Srclib toolchain for license scanning, based off of the Nomos license scanner.  Also does some license inferencing and other stuff.

## Usage

Make the nomos binary and then .  Please edit `nomos/makefile.conf` to pass the build on your system.  

TODO: Possibly vendorize the nomossa binary to avoid building on each new system.

`npm install`
`cd ./nomos`
`make CFLAGS=-I/usr/include/glib-2.0` //either omit CFLAGS or edit it to wherever GLIB is on your system (check in cellar if installed with brew on OSX)
